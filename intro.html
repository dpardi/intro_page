  		<h1>Introduction</h1> 
    		<p>I'm a newly crowned mathematician who has studied at CUNY - Brooklyn College and SUNY - Empire College. I play the viola, read Popular Science and have all the other essential nerd qualities (yes, I'm team Star Trek).</p>
    		<p>I am extremely passionate about <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2015/nsf15311/">STEM education for women</a>. I've always felt there has lacked a certain level of support in the field, however am excited to see how my generation is taking the foreground and being advocates for women and our youth.</p> 
  		<h1>Where am I from?</h1>
   			<p>I've lived in over 10 states, however recently relocated down south from Brooklyn where I lived for around 10 years.</p>

   		<h2>More About Me</h2>
   		<h3>Dream Job?</h3> 
       		<p class = "answer">My dream job involves me solving problems. I've always loved math because it allows you to take a step back and envision the various ways to a solution. I'm hoping to take that same approach to larger real-world problems, finding solutions where many assume there are none.</p>
    
   		<h3>Favorite Hobbies?</h3>
       		<p>My hobbies are pretty vast, most recently I'm taking up Fly Fishing. Being close to nature has inspired me to get outside and enjoy the fresh air (and the lovely rivers). I also enjoy gardening vegitables in my container garden, and playing with my dog Betty Davis. I hope to one day add to the clan, and possible take up Bee Keeping.</p>
     
     	<h3>Music Listening To?</h3>
     		<p>Lately I've been listening to a lot of old country music. Loretta Lynn and Patsy Cline are staples in my household.</p>
